# Bitcoin's Market Influence on Energy Consumption: A Data-Driven Perspective

## Overview

This project addresses the pivotal intersection of cryptocurrency's financial success and its environmental sustainability, focusing on Bitcoin's substantial energy consumption. Our analysis delves into the direct relationship between Bitcoin's market activity and its energy demand, unveiling the ecological challenges that arise from the cryptocurrency's operation.

## Data Overview

We synthesized data reflecting Bitcoin's market behavior—prices, trading volumes, and market cap—with its estimated energy consumption and carbon emissions data. This combination provided a holistic view of Bitcoin's environmental footprint over an extensive timeframe.

**Data Sources:** Historical price data and environmental impact reports from various financial and academic institutions, spanning 2010 to the present.

## Key Questions

1. **Correlation Assessment:** Does Bitcoin's market volatility correlate with its energy consumption and emissions? How do these variables interact over different periods?
   
2. **Sustainability Analysis:** What are the implications of Bitcoin's energy use trends for its long-term sustainability, and what measures could mitigate its environmental impact?
   
3. **Predictive Modeling:** Can we predict future energy consumption based on current market trends? How effective are our models, such as LSTM, in forecasting these outcomes?

## Getting Started

To replicate our study and explore the link between Bitcoin's market behaviors and energy consumption:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/RutwizG/Bit-coin-Environmental-Impacts.git
   ```
2. **Environment setup:**
   - Python is a prerequisite with libraries `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`, `matplotlib`.
3. **Run the analysis:**
   - `bitcoin_environmental_analysis.ipynb` details the construction and validation of our predictive LSTM model.

## Findings

Our models indicate a strong, predictive correlation between Bitcoin market activity and its environmental impact, with LSTM providing robust future projections. This calls for actionable strategies to ensure the cryptocurrency's growth aligns with environmental sustainability.
