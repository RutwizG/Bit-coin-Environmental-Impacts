# The Environmental Crossroads of Cryptocurrency: Analyzing Bitcoin's Impact

## Overview

This project delves into the environmental implications of Bitcoin, the pioneering digital currency that has revolutionized our perception of money. Amidst its financial success, Bitcoin's escalating energy consumption and carbon emissions have raised significant environmental concerns. Our investigation aims to unravel the magnitude of Bitcoin's ecological footprint, leveraging comprehensive data on its energy usage and emissions since 2010.

## Data Overview

The dataset provides an in-depth analysis of Bitcoin's electricity consumption and the resultant carbon emissions, primarily fueled by non-renewable energy sources such as coal, oil, and gas. Spanning from 2010 to the present, it offers detailed insights into the highest, lowest, and 'optimal' estimates of Bitcoin's energy consumption and emission figures, presenting a nuanced view of its environmental impact.

**Data Source:** [Dataset on bitcoin carbon footprint and energy consumption](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Dataset_on_bitcoin_carbon_footprint_and_energy_consumption/19442933/1)

## Key Questions

1. **Trend Analysis:** How has Bitcoin's energy consumption and carbon emissions fluctuated over the years? Are there identifiable patterns or specific periods of significant increase or decrease?
   
2. **Market vs. Environment:** Is there a correlation between Bitcoin's market behavior (price fluctuations) and its environmental impact (energy use and emissions)? Which market events closely align with changes in environmental metrics?
   
3. **Anomalies Identification:** Have there been instances of abrupt changes in Bitcoin's energy consumption or emissions that deviate from the norm? What could be the underlying causes—increased mining activity, advancements in mining technology, or other factors?
